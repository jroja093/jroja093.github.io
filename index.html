        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout my career in the workforce, I have gained valuable experience that I believe directly translates to the responsibilities of a financial role. Firstly, my experience has honed my communication skills, enabling me to convey information clearly and professionally. I understand the importance of clear and concise communication when collaborating with other students, faculty, and staff members. I am confident in my ability to effectively communicate and address any concerns or questions that may arise. My proficiency in communication was built on my mistakes and success and an example of that would be when I helped customers find what they wanted from deals and plans my familyâ€™s business offered to accidentally leaving out key details in the plan. I understand that for a business to succeed there must be proper communication.<br><br>
        Furthermore, throughout my work experience, I developed strong leadership skills, which will be directly applicable to a financial role. I have led a team of employees through the day and night shifts as a shift leader, ensuring tasks were completed efficiently, on time, and to the highest standard. I made sure the area we worked in was held to the highest standard and I made sure to deal with customer complaints whenever the manager was not there. I maintained a positive work environment and offered guidance and support to team members when necessary. I go out of my way to offer help anywhere thatâ€™s needed or thatâ€™s struggling.  These leadership skills will be invaluable in my ability to guide and assist fellow coworkers and to grow the company in the future. <br><br>
        Additionally, my experience working has enhanced my decision-making capabilities. In a fast-paced and demanding environment, I often had to make quick and effective decisions to solve problems and keep operations running smoothly. I recognize the importance of making informed decisions on time, particularly when assisting other customers or coworkers to not hold back the line or the business. Furthermore, I possess excellent organizational and time management skills, which will enable me to handle multiple responsibilities efficiently and prioritize tasks effectively as seen with my house cleaning part-time and my shift leader position where I had to hold down the business multiple times. I am confident in being able to help the business I work for succeed with the many challenges thrown my way. I also look for new ways to grow my skills and to grow my knowledge in the work field. An example of my eagerness can be seen when I would go to every new job opportunity that was offered to me such as internships in college, being able to work at a completely new location with the same business, and talking to difficult customers in order to understand them a bit more.
